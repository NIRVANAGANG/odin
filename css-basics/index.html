    <!-- ABOUT OUR CSS BASICS -->
    <h1>we've got three main things in css</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Selector</li>
      <li>Property</li>
      <li>Value</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Now we are going to see the type of selectors -->
    <p>There are 6 types of selectors</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Universial selectors</li>
      <li>Class selectors</li>
      <li>ID selectors</li>
      <li>Grouping selectors</li>
      <li>Chaining selectors</li>
      <li>Descendant combinator</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The first one is denoted by an asterisk(*)</p>
    <p>class selectors are denoted by a period(.).They can be many.</p>
    <p>
      ID selectors are denoted by a hashtag(#).It is <strong>unique</strong> in
      nature,only one can be used at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grouping selectors are used to group elements with the same style
      declaration.For example if h1 and h2 have the same background color and
      color we can group them instead of styling them individually
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaining selectors are used to chain elements as lists without seperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descendant combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently
      than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between
      the selectors.
